Day 5: Timing Analysis and Optimization Using OpenSTA and TritonCTS
Static Timing Analysis with OpenSTA
You use OpenSTA to perform static timing analysis, ensuring that the CMOS inverter meets timing requirements.

Key Steps:

Clock Tree Setup: Define the clock signal and set up the clock tree for timing analysis.
Path Delay Analysis: Evaluate the timing of different paths in the circuit, identifying any critical paths that could lead to timing violations.
Slack Calculation: Calculate slack to determine how much margin you have before timing violations occur.
Clock Tree Synthesis with TritonCTS
You use TritonCTS to synthesize the clock tree, optimizing the clock distribution for minimal skew and delay.

Key Steps:

Clock Buffer Insertion: Insert clock buffers to strengthen the clock signal and reduce skew.
Skew and Latency Optimization: Adjust the placement and sizing of clock buffers to minimize skew and latency across the clock tree.
Final Timing Validation: Perform a final timing analysis to ensure that the clock tree meets the timing requirements, with no violations or issues.
Optimization Techniques
You apply various optimization techniques to improve the overall performance of the CMOS inverter and its timing characteristics.

Key Steps:

Transistor Sizing Optimization: Adjust the width and length of the NMOS and PMOS transistors to balance speed, power, and area.
Buffer Insertion for Delay Reduction: Insert buffers in critical paths to reduce propagation delay.
Power Optimization: Implement power gating or use low-power cells to reduce the overall power consumption while maintaining performance.

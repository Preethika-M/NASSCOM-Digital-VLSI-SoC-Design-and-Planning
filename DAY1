KEY LEARNINGS:
Theory 1: Open-Source EDA, OpenLANE & SKY130 PDK
RTL to GDSII Flow:

The RTL to GDSII flow is the process of converting high-level hardware descriptions (RTL) into a physical layout (GDSII) ready for fabrication. It involves several steps, including synthesis, floorplanning, placement, routing, and signoff checks.
Key checks include DRC, LVS, and STA, ensuring the design's correctness before it is fabricated.
QFN-48 Chip Components:

Core: The central part of the chip where the primary logic is implemented.
IO Pads: Act as communication channels between the core and the external environment.
Die: The area on the silicon wafer that includes both the core and IO pads.
IPs (Intellectual Property): Pre-designed blocks like ADCs, DACs, and PLLs, requiring manual intervention during design.
Introduction to OpenLANE:

OpenLANE is an open-source ASIC design flow built around the SKY130 PDK. It automates the RTL to GDSII flow using various tools and scripts.
Lab 1: Getting Familiar with Open Source EDA Tools
OpenLANE Directory Structure:

Understanding the structure of OpenLANE directories and important files, such as PDKs, design libraries, and technology-specific files, is crucial for navigating the tool.
Synthesis Process:

The synthesis process converts RTL code into a gate-level netlist. The lab demonstrated how to prepare a design, run synthesis, and review the synthesized results using OpenLANE.
Linux Command Line Basics:

Familiarity with basic Linux commands like cd, ls, and docker is essential for working in the OpenLANE environment.

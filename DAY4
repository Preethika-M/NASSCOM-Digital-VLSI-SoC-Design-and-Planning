Day 4: CMOS Inverter Characterization
Timing Analysis of CMOS Inverter
You perform timing analysis to determine the inverter’s performance in terms of delay and speed.

Key Steps:

Propagation Delay Measurement: Measure the time it takes for the output to change in response to a change in the input signal.
Rise/Fall Time Analysis: Evaluate the rise time (time taken for the output to go from low to high) and fall time (time taken for the output to go from high to low).
Load Capacitance Effects: Analyze how different load capacitances affect the inverter’s delay and power consumption.
Noise Margin Calculation
You calculate the noise margins to ensure that the inverter operates reliably in the presence of noise.

Key Steps:

Determine VOH and VOL: Measure the output high (VOH) and output low (VOL) voltages.
Calculate NMH and NML: Determine the noise margin high (NMH) and noise margin low (NML) using the VOH, VOL, VIH (input high voltage), and VIL (input low voltage).
Power Consumption Analysis
You analyze the power consumption of the CMOS inverter during its operation.

Key Steps:

Dynamic Power Calculation: Evaluate the power consumed during switching activity, considering the load capacitance and switching frequency.
Static Power Calculation: Measure the leakage current and calculate the static power consumption when the inverter is not switching.
Total Power Consumption: Sum the dynamic and static power to determine the total power consumption of the inverter.
